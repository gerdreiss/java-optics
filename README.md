[A lens is basically a getter/setter that can be used for deep updates of immutable data.](http://davids-code.blogspot.de/2014/02/immutable-domain-and-lenses-in-java-8.html)

In the case of this library, mutable data can obviously be read/updated, too. It's Java, for Pete's sake. There is hardly anything immutable.
